# Project Portfolio

This repository contains my solutions and personal adaptations for the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp** on Udemy.  
The focus is on **project-based learning** — every folder contains a standalone project with its own README, code, and tests.

## 📂 Structure
- Each project is stored in its own folder: `001/`, `002/`, … `100/`
- Inside each project folder:
  - `src/` – source code
  - `README.md` – project description, run instructions, and notes
  - `requirements.txt` – dependencies
  - `tests/` – optional unit tests

## 🏆 Goals
- Strengthen Python fundamentals
- Build a diverse portfolio of real, working projects
- Practice clean code, version control, and documentation
